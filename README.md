# CS-320-R4846-Software-Test-Automation-QA-24EW4

This is a repository for the class CS 320 course at SNHU. The class focuses on automated testing Java applications through JUnit. All tests and code were developed by myself.

**Project One**
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
  - Create unit tests using code to uncover errors

**Project Two**
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
  - Analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements
  - Apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements

**Final Reflections**
1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - I believe a manual review is important even for automated testing. Plug-in testing like JUnit or NUnit was incredibly useful, but I felt like manually reviewing the code in detail is just as important. Not more important but as important (if that makes sense). The two should be used together so you can see your flaws and fix them. I was always taught to write and fix it later. I was a Criminal Justice Major before Computer Science so writing 20 page papers comes natural to me.
   
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - "User needs" should be what drives the initial development. It's hard to ignore them at any point of SDLC. An important thing to remember is the user wants the world, and you know that you may only deliver a continent, but creativity is rewarded when it results in other options to the same results. Turn "can't" into "let's try ...", this is a must skill a developer should have.
   
3. How do I approach designing software?
  - I have multiple different ways and can't always decide how to start. I can see the big picture and the details of the picture. My approach usually starts with some coffee and me pondering what I want the application to do in the end. Start then by doing one small piece at a time. Like I said up top, I just start typing not knowing where it will lead and the fixes come after. Roadblocks are annoying, but I work through them by using different solutions. Usually my code gets longer and longer and I have to shorten it up to have better readability. I rely on the ones that came before me, so not to reinvent but to modify the wheel to fit my own needs.
